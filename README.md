# ScanToPDF

Work time - around 35 hours in total

This project is by far my most satisfying implementation, starting with that I was totally unaware of how to implement 80% of functions occuring in application, however with time I seem to understand more of its concepts. I completely learned how to support fully working camera with croping, attaching from gallery, accessing all files, requesting advanced permissions and even more details like shapes, animations, transitions and other UI related things.

App basically is designed to take photo/import from gallery of a document and post nor save it to the PDF file so it can easily be sent with other sources.

To play around with this app/project you have to download library for OpenCV and Camera croping made by mayuce: https://github.com/mayuce/AndroidDocumentScanner
